This folder contains the key visualizations from the automobile price prediction analysis.

## Diagnostic Plots
- **Q-Q Plot**: Normal probability plot of standardized residuals to check normality assumptions
- **Residuals vs Fitted Values**: Scatter plot to assess homoscedasticity and model fit
- **Boxplot of Residuals**: Shows residual distribution across fitted value segments

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Price Distribution Histograms**: Original vs log-transformed price distributions
- **Scatterplot Matrix**: Pairwise relationships between key variables
- **Variable Relationship Plots**: Individual scatter plots for model development

## Model Comparison
- **Cp Plot**: Model selection criterion comparison across the three models

*Note: Plots are generated by running the analysis.R script. Original plots are embedded in the full report PDF.*
